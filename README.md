* this reducer should support the following interactions 
  * `EXPENSE_CREATE` -- store an expense
  * `EXPENSE_UPDATE` -- update an existing expense
  * `EXPENSE_DELETE` -- delete an existing expense
* if you need others feel free to add them

###### action creators
* you should create an action creator for each interaction supported by your expenses reducer

###### store
* in `lib/store.js` exports a function that will return a redux store from your app reducer

##### Components
Create the following components and structure them according to the following diagram.  
``` 
App
  Provider 
    BrowserRouter
      Route / Dashboard
        CategoryForm -- for creating categories
        [CategoryItem] -- list of CategoryItems

           ExpenseForm -- for creating expenses
           [ExpenseItem]  -- list of ExpenseItems

##### ExpenseItem Component 
* should have a button that will delete the expense from the Apps `onClick`
* should display the `name` and `price` of the component
* should display an ExpenseForm that will enable the user to update the expense in the app state
